                    <h4>Japanese Foreign Policy</h4>
        
            <h3>Why was Japan expansionist?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased confidence after victories in Russo-Japanese (1904-05) and Sino-Japanese (1894-95) wars</li>
                <li>The Russo-Japanese war resulted in Japan getting Manchurian railways which facilitated entry to China</li>
                <li>The Sino-Japanese war resulted in Japan getting Taiwan</li>
                <li>Japan’s mountainous terrain meant they had limited access to resources</li>
                <li>America used gunboat diplomacy in the 1850s to get Japan to open up which didn’t sit well with their nationalism</li>
                <li>Zaibatsu: The military leaders had formed ties with large corporations. Thus with an assertive foreign policy the Zaibatsu would modernise weapons and the military would use them helping Japan expand (Military Industrial Complex). This was furthered by the industrialisation seen in the Meiji restoration.</li>
                <li>World War One stimulated Japan’s industry due to their limited involvement in it thus stimulating MIC</li>
                <li>After the Great Depression Japan’s economy suffered as they could no longer get imports of fossil fuels. Silk exports had fallen by 40% as well as issues with food shortages and unemployment.</li>
                <li>This made them tempted to expand in order to solve these issues.</li>
                <li>China seemed like the perfect target as it was weakened by the 1927 civil war.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Post Manchuria:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2nd Sino-Japanese War: July 1937 Japanese troops had a clash with Chinese troops in Marco Polo Bridge triggering war.</li>
                <li>December 1937 Japan captures China’s capital Nanjing.</li>
                <li>December 1941 50% of Japan’s army occupied China but after Pearl Harbor Japan was now having to deal with the USA aiding China</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Invasion of Indochina:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>September 1940 Japan invades French Indochina</li>
                <li>They did this to prevent China from importing through there</li>
                <li>The USA responded by imposing oil and iron embargos in July 1941 (only 5 months before Pearl Harbor)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Causes of Pearl Harbor:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Japan wanted to weaken US navy to take full control of Pacific</li>
                <li>USA was helping China in Sino-Japanese War</li>
                <li>USA’s embargo policy</li>
                <li>Resentment for USA’s growing influence in Pacific</li>
                <li>Tripartite pact (Japan Germany and Italy) signed in September 1940 gave Japan confidence</li>
                <li>Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact signed in April 1941 increased Japan’s confidence</li>
                <li>USA said they wouldn’t recognise Manchuria as Japanese territory</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Italian Foreign Policy</h4>
        
            <h3>1920s Major Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mussolini wants to rebuild Italian national pride of Roman Empire</li>
                <li>Mussolini felt Italy was owed more from the Paris Peace Treaties they were given only parts of territories for instance German-speaking Tyrol</li>
                <li>Mussolini also wanted to dominate the Balkans and Mediterranean</li>
                <li>He also wanted Spazio Vitale (living space) as well as expansion in Africa</li>
                <li>Mussolini wanted a corporate state with Autarky meaning all workers and employers worked towards the good of the state eliminating class divisions and corporations were regulated by the government for a self-sufficient nation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Foreign Policy in the 1920s:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Corfu Affair in 1923: Italy invaded the Greek Island of Corfu after an Italian official was killed there</li>
                <li>Seizure of Fiume in 1924</li>
                <li>1924 Treaty of Friendship with Albania: Albania becomes protectorate of Italy</li>
                <li>1925 Locarno Treaty: Confirmation with West and mutually guaranteeing European borders</li>
                <li>1928 Kellogg Briand Pact: Promise not to use war to solve disputes with many countries in Europe</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Despite Locarno Treaty and Kellogg Briand Pact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mussolini still supported right-wing movements in Germany and was training German Airforce in clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles.</li>
            <li>Mussolini also supported independence movements in French Morocco.</li>
            <li>There were also violent suppressions of revolts in Italian Libya.</li>
            <li>Mussolini promised to build an Air Force greater than any other despite all these agreements that supposedly ensured peace.</li>
            <li>The Great Depression only furthered the economic need to expand with industrial production falling by 25%.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>Aggression in the 1930s</h3>
        
            <p>Factors leading to expansion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fascism</li>
                <li>Call for imperial expansion</li>
                <li>Loss of foreign investors</li>
                <li>Crashing grain prices hurt farmers</li>
                <li>Drive towards autarky following the Great Depression</li>
            </ul>
        

        <p>Four Power Pact (July 1933)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Italy, Britain, France, and Germany.</li>
            <li>Reaffirmed Great Power influence in Europe.</li>
            <li>Moved troops to Northern border to support Austria from German threat.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stresa Front (April 1935)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To maintain the status quo in Europe in light of German rearmament between Italy, Britain, and France.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Abyssinian Crisis (1935-36)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Done to expand into Africa as always desired and gain support for the government.</li>
            <li>Avenge the 1890s defeat in the Battle of Adwa.</li>
            <li>Sought to gain colonial troops and market for Italian goods.</li>
            <li>In December 1934, Wal Wal Oasis dispute occurred, and Mussolini demanded apology and compensation while Abyssinia requested the League to investigate.</li>
            <li>In October 1935, 500,000 Italian troops invaded and the League condemned and sanctioned Italy.</li>
            <li>In May 1936, Italy successfully annexed Abyssinia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Results of Second Italo-Ethiopian War (Oct. 1935-May 1936)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boosted Mussolini’s ego and hubris.</li>
            <li>Exposed League of Nations via Hoare-Laval Pact.</li>
            <li>Ended Stresa Front, causing Italy and Germany to get closer.</li>
            <li>Italian budget deficiency of 13 billion Lire as it was devalued by 40%.</li>
            <li>Drain of economic and military resources.</li>
            <li>Sanctions forced Italy to shift to Germany.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Spanish Civil War</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opportunity for Mussolini to support fascism.</li>
            <li>Gain naval bases in the Western Mediterranean.</li>
            <li>70,000 troops joined; more than any other nation.</li>
            <li>This led to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Depletion of economy and military.</li>
                <li>Increased tension with Britain and France.</li>
                <li>New alliances (Rome-Berlin Axis November 1937, Anti-Comintern Pact December 1937, Italy leaves League of Nations).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        </ul>
