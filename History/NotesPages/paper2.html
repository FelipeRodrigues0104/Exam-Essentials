                        <h4>Consolidation of power</h4>
                        
                        <h3>Use of law</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Following the Reichstag fire of February 1933, Hitler was able to pass the Decree of the protection of people and the State and Enabling Act</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The decree for the protection of people and the state allowed Hitler to suspend constitutional rights under the pretence of national safety</li>
                                <li>The Enabling Act allowed Hitler to bypass the Reichstag and pass laws directly</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Both propelled Hitler into a position of authoritarianism.</li>
                                    <li>These were past lawfully, and therefore also legitimised his power over the country and therefore neutralised any public resistance as to Hitler having such power</li>
                                    <li>They also came after the Reichstag fire portrayed Hitler as a saviour of Germany's democracy and adding to his respectability</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>5 months later, the Law Against the Formation of Parties was passed and helped consolidate Hitler's power </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inhibited freedom of assembly and there were essentially no other alternatives, thus, the Nazis won 92% of the votes in the Reichstag in November 1933.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>In August 1934, Hitler fully consolidated his position with the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich, which merged the offices of President and Chancellor</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This was then legitimised by a plebiscite</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                            


                            <h3>Centralisation of government</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gleischaltung</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In May 1933, the German Labour Front (DAF) was formed, as a state-controlled organisation to replace trade unions which were banned</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Helped Nazis put into line all workers who might rebel</li>
                                    <li>Promote Volksgemeinschaft and Strength Through Joy and bring about sense of unity</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>In January 1934, the Law for the Reconstruction of the State dissolved elected state assemblies and created the position of Nazi gauleiter (Reich governors) created to run states</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This law allowed the Nazis to spread their control over the entirety of Germany and obtain nation-wide consolidation of power</li>
                                <li>For example, with Goebbels reporting back to Hitler any troubles caused in Berlin</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Following the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler had the army swear an oath of allegiance to him which meant no one would go after him. The oath was to Adolf Hitler, not the position of Fuhrer.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Force</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Following the Reichstag Fire of February 1933, Hitler persecuted 300,000 communists as the fire had allegedly been caused by Dutch communist Marinus Van der Lubbe thus excusing his actions</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This not only portrayed him as a protector of Germany but a growing fear from communists towards the Nazis ensued</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The Night of the Long Knives (June 1934) eliminated rivals and political opponents of Hitler's, inside and outside the party, such as Ernst Röhm, Kurt Von Schleicher, and Gregor Strasser</li>
                            <li>SS, SA and particularly the Gestapo created a fear among the population that they wouldn't even mention to their closest friends any criticism of the Nazis which further consolidated their position as no revolutions could gain momentum.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In February 1933, The Decree for the Protection of the Nation and the State gave secret police the power to hold people indefinitely</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Propaganda and wide appeal</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In March 1933, the New ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda was established.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>With Joseph Goebbels as its head, he ensured strict control over all forms of media, while promoting Nazi ideals through newspapers, films, literature etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Projects such as Autobahn that promoted employment and pleased the 6 million people unemployed at the time</li>
                            <li>Hitler's conciliatory approach was also very helpful, for example with the Concordat with the Pope in July 1933</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Church would not interfere with government's activity</li>
                                <li>Gained support of all Catholics with this</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Historians such as Ian Kershaw are known for describing Hitler as having a "dark charisma", his work focused on how Hitler's image and persona contributed to his consolidation of power</li>
                        </ul>
